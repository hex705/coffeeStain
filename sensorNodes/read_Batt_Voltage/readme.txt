Measure voltage experiment:

using pololu voltage stepup down converter with 5V output.

why do this?

give regulated power from variable source -- so a 3.7LIpo can be used to output 5V.

also we can sense battery voltage with a stable power supply.

Using analog read on input and output of the v-reg and feeding the arduino with power to Vin,

can watch teh voltage on input fluctuate without changing the output.


yippy -- can monitor the voltage in a battery with this system.
